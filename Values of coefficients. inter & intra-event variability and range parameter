Finding values of b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10
done using design.m


Estimation of τ² (Inter-event Variability) and σ² (Intra-event Variability)
- scoring.m estimates τ² (Inter-event Variability) and σ² (Intra-event Variability)
- generator.m uses it for generating synthtic data
- prediction.m uses it for quantifying uncertainities in ground-motion predictions


Calculating h (range parameter of correlation functions)
- semivariogram.m → Computes the semivariogram and fits h.
- scoring.m → Estimates h using Maximum Likelihood Estimation.
- generator.m → Uses h to generate correlated random fields.
- prediction.m → Uses h for spatial interpolation of ground motion.
